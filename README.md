Challenges for PHP Developers
==============

Depending on the position you're applying, you'll be utilizing either the "**junior**" or "**senior**" folder. Each of the subfolders contains a task. Inside the task folder you'll find a README.md file which will contain the task at hand.

## Goals
### Juniors / Apprentice positions

The core principle I adhere is that young developers should display the ability to learn and adapt. Only the logical minds, focused, adaptable, people who are self-motivated by learning and advancing are the ones that really build great teams. These tasks are made for them. Not particularly reusable, someone might argue. However, these tasks are tailored specifically to cover most of the core principles and test from all the angles if a candidate has what it takes, aat least when it comes to programming skills. Unbiased about principles and implementation, heavily focused on goals and performance.

### Seniors

A senior developer should be able to debate and discuss the technology at hand. One can only allow itself to do that with the knowledge of the inner workings of PHP. From a pragmatic point of view, a senior developer should know about design patterns, SOLID, PSR standardization, dependency injection, MVC and code architecture in general. Strong knowledge about RDBMS and ORM is imperative. A senior should also be able to working in Agile environments, and teach other team members about refactoring and additional project requirements, which is essential in real-life projects. Their tasks are quite different to the ones juniors will complete, as testing these programmatically could be tedious and mostly unsuccessful.

## Rules

 - **Fork the code!** No pull request will be accepted or considered. Fork the repository to your GitHub account and push your changes to it.
 - Code for tasks should be placed inside the specific task folder where the description is located.
 - Each task might have specific rules or requirements, read carefully.
 - Any questions and issues will be handled thought GitHub issues.
