Yin Yang implementation
========================

Create a script that prints out number from 1 to 100. If the number is divisable by 3, print the string "Yin" instead of the number in place. If the number is divisable by 5, print the string "Yang" instead. If the number is divisable by both 3 and 5, print out "Yin Yang". If the file is not divisable by neither 3 nor 5, print the number as-is.
