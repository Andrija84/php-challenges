Review/improve an open-source project
====================================

This is a real-life working project that I've been developing a couple of years back, and recently, started updating it while constantly laughing at some choices I made. The library is called ZLO, it's a gettext-like inline translation and localization object that will be used in our new project. It's writen from scratch and thus independent from any external libraries.
