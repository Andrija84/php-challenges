Review/improve an open-source project
====================================

This is a real-life working project that I've been developing a couple of years back, and recently, started updating it while constantly laughing at some choices I made. The library is called ZLO, it's a gettext-like inline translation and localization object that will be used in our new project. It's writen from scratch and thus independent from any external libraries.

There is broken code, there is code that's implemented but not used. It's PSR-4 compatible and you can load it using Composer too by listing `zamphyr/zlo` as a dependency.

## Your task

 - Look at TODOs and code
