Senior challenges
=========================

**You choose one of the two offered challenges.**

 - Challenge #1 is created to test the deepest knowledge of PHP. You should prevent eye strain by giving up after 8 hours of looking at it in wonder.

 - Challenge #2 offers your a deal with the devil. The challenge takes an open-source project that will be used in our forthcoming adventures, and gives it to you for review. You have to tell me what you would do with that code, or even better, actually code and submit pull requests. Look at TODOs, current code, consume the code. Keep in mind that it has to be impressive to make up for the fact that you gave up solving the first challenge like a chicken.


## Vagrant box for senior challenges

The directory `box` holds a Vagrantfile that sets up a Vagrant box with:

 - Apache 2.4
 - PHP 5.6.3
 - Composer
 - MariaDB
 - Redis

Use it to complete the coding tasks at hand.
